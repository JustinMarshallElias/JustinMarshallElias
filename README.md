- 👋 Hi, I’m @JustinMarshallElias 
- 👀 I’m a composer and music artist with a very unique Instagram account where I write music for still visuals. It's sorta like tranlasting one language into another. 
- 🌱 I’m currently a working artist, primarily doing music and sound design for indie productions and high budget industrials. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on low budget indie games as I'm a huge gamer and I have a lot to offer the world of video game soundtracks.
- 📫 How to reach me ... via email or my Instagram account under the same name.
